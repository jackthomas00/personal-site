        <h3>TradeCRE Encryption & Permissions</h3>
        <span class="pill pill-soft">Security / Systems</span>
      </header>
      <p>
        End-to-end style encryption model for collaboration: per-user symmetric keys, encrypted
        document keys, and role-based sharing with minimal trust in the server.
      </p>
      <ul class="card-list">
        <li>Designed key hierarchy for users, groups, and documents.</li>
        <li>Implemented client-side encryption flows integrated with API and database models.</li>
        <li>Balanced security with usability for non-technical real-estate professionals.</li>
      </ul>

        <h3>Multi-Agent Traffic Light RL</h3>
        <span class="pill pill-soft">RL / Simulation</span>
      </header>
      <p>
        Multi-agent reinforcement learning controller for traffic lights using SUMO,
        aiming to reduce congestion and stabilize flows under realistic traffic patterns.
      </p>
      <ul class="card-list">
        <li>Built training loop with custom reward functions and dynamic weighting.</li>
        <li>Used Ray Tune to search over hyperparameters and policies.</li>
        <li>Evaluated agents on realistic traffic patterns and bottlenecks.</li>
      </ul>

        <h3>Open Knowledge Compiler (OKC)</h3>
        <span class="pill pill-soft">NLP / Knowledge</span>
      </header>
      <p>
        Prototype of a "knowledge substrate" that turns raw text into structured entities, claims,
        and relations, so agents can retrieve and reason over explicit facts instead of just embeddings.
      </p>            
      <ul class="card-list">
        <li>Pipeline for entity extraction, claim detection, and relation typing.</li>
        <li>Structured storage with pgvector for semantic search.</li>
        <li>Focus on transparency and evidence-backed retrieval for agents.</li>
      </ul>
